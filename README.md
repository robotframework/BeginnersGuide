# Beginners Guide to Robot Framework

## Introduction

Hello! So you want to learn Robot Framework? This guide is everything you need for getting started! You donâ€™t need any previous experience in test automation to use this guide. You will learn how to install Robot Framework on your computer and get started building cool automation.

## Installation

1. First, check if your computer already has Python programming language. Open Terminal/Command Prompt and type in:
```
python --version
```
2. If Python is not installed, download and install latest version from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If installing to Windows, check "Add Python to PATH" in the Python installer.
3. Restart the Terminal/Command Prompt program after Python installation.
4. Next, install Robot Framework. Type in to Terminal/Command Prompt:
```
pip install robotframework
```
If installation was succesful, this command prints robot version:
```
robot --version
```
Wow! Robot Framework is now ready to be used!

### Troubleshooting installation

If command pip does not work, most probable reason is that Python is not found. There are two options to tackle this:

Option 1: Add Python to PATH. Robot Framework's installation instructions include [in-depth instructions for modifying PATH](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst#configuring-path).

Option 2: Or if you use Windows, run Python using command `py -m `:
```
py -m pip install robotframework
```
and for checking if installation was succesful:
```
py -m robot --version
```

### Selecting code editor

Simple robot automation can be written using a any text editor, even Notepad. Check list of [suggested editors on Robot Framework's homepage](https://robotframework.org/#tools). If you don't have preference, very popular editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), that has really good [Robot Framework extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomiTurtiainen.rf-intellisense).

## Writing a first automation case

Following example shows how to write your first robot automation case:

1. Create a new file and save it using an extension `.robot`, for example, `my_first.robot`
2. Write in file `*** Test Cases ***`. This creates [section](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-data-sections) for test cases.
3. Type in following (note to add the four spaces before `Log To Console`)

    ```robotframework
    My First Robot Test
        Log To Console            Hello Robot World!
    ```

4. First test is now ready and it should look like this:

    ```robotframework
    *** Test Cases ***

    My First Robot Test
        Log To Console            Hello Robot World!
    ```

    <div data-notebook="Examples/my_first.robot"></div>

5. Open Terminal/Command Prompt. Navigate to the same folder where your `.robot` file is located and run the test by inputting command `robot my_first.robot`. For example:

    ```
    cd your_folder
    robot my_first.robot
    ```

6. When Robot is run, you will see this:

    ```
    > robot my_first.robot
    ==============================================================================
    My First                                                                      
    ==============================================================================
    My First Robot Test                                                   Hello Robot World!
    My First Robot Test                                                   | PASS |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    My First                                                              | PASS |
    1 critical test, 1 passed, 0 failed
    1 test total, 1 passed, 0 failed
    ==============================================================================
    Output:  /output.xml
    Log:     /log.html
    Report:  /report.html

    ``` 
Robot has created test report files in the same folder where you run the test. You can check details of the first test run by opening report.html file.
